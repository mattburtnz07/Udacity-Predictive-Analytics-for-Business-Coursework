# Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Coursework
This repo holds my coursework from the Udacity Predictive Analytics for Business course. This course used Tableau and Alteryx for data analytics and predictive modelling.
Showcased are segmentation techniques, classification and regression using alteryx with Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Boosted and Neural Network models to name a few. Also showcased is time series analysis with Alteryx.
Projects are split into their own folders with a summary html file and project folders.

It was a great course and I really enjoyed using Tableau and Alteryx for data analytics.
