# Udacity-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business-Coursework
This repo holds my coursework from the Udacity Predictive Analytics for Business course. This course used Tableau and Alteryx for data analytics and predictive modelling.
Showcased are segmentation techniques, classification and regression using alteryx with Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Boosted and Neural Network models to name a few. Also showcased is time series analysis with Alteryx.
Projects are split into their own folders with a summary html file and project folders.

It was a great course and I really enjoyed using Tableau and Alteryx for data analytics.

1: Project 1 - Predicting Catalogue Demand  
This project was to use a linear regressor in Alteryx to predict the expected return of a marketing project. The end result was to use this prediction to make a business decision  

2: Project 2 - Create an Analytical Dataset  
This project showcases data manipulation by preparing data for analysis. It also involves dealing with outliers in data  

3: Project 3 - Predicting Default Risk  
This project involves formatting data and training a classification model to predict default risk and assess whether a customer is a good credit risk. Four models were trained using Alteryx including; logistic regression, decision tree, forest model and boosted model. These models were compared and the best chosen to assess the default risk for the company.  

4: Project 4 - AB Test a New Menu Launch  
This project involves conducting an A/B Test on the introduction of an updated menu and television advertising campaign for a coffee chain using Alteryx. The results of this analysis are used to determine whether the updated menu would be implemnented in all stores across the chain. Another key part of the project was creating trend and seasonality variables for the analysis.

5: Project 5 - Forecasting Sales  
This project involves conducting time-series analysis using monthly sales data to help with business planning. This was done using ETS and ARIMA models in Alteryx.  

6: Project 6 - Capstone - Combining Predictive Techniques  
This is the capstone project of the course and involves bringing all of the skills learned in the course together using Alteryx and Tableau.
